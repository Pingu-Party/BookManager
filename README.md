# Book Manager 1.0
A simple PHP web application that allows to manage information about books, like the book title, authors and publisher. Additionally, information about the book's physical location can be stored. Books can be grouped in categories and a search feature allows to  search for certain books.

The book manager comes with an Android app which allows to scan the ISBN code of a book and then retrieves data about it automatically from the  [Google Books APIs](https://developers.google.com/books). This way, books can be added to the book manager quite easily.

The Android app will be published in its own repository and is thus not described below.

## Core Features
- Storing information about books, including:
  - Book title and subtitle
  - Book description

- Searching for books by keywords (among title, subtitle, description and publisher)

## Available languages
At the moment, the book manager is only available in German language. This may change however.
